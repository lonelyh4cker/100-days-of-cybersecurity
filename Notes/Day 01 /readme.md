### 🔹 Why Cyber Security Is Important
Companies and individuals face many security issues such as:
- Data breaches

### 🔹 Ethical Hacking & Industries
Ethical hacking is used across many industries:

### 🔹 Ethical Hacking Process
An ethical hacker follows a **legal and structured approach**:

1. **Permission** – Written authorization from the company  
2. **Scope Definition** – What systems can be tested  
3. **Reconnaissance** – Information gathering  
4. **Execution** – Testing for vulnerabilities  
5. **Reporting** – Documenting findings and fixes  

⚠️ Ethical hackers **do not exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain**.  
A **pentester** may exploit vulnerabilities only to prove impact — still within permission.
