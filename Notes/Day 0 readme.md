## 📌 Day 0 Topics Covered

### 🔹 GitHub Basics
- Understanding repositories
- Commits and version history
- Branching concepts

### 🔹 Forking a Repository
- How to fork a public repository
- Why forking is important for open-source collaboration

### 🔹 Notes Branch
- A separate `notes` branch is used to save personal notes related to specific cybersecurity topics
- Keeps the `main` branch clean and organized

### 🔹 Contribution Rules
- **Do NOT commit notes directly to the `main` branch**
- Notes should be added only in the `notes` branch
- Code contributions (if required) should be made in a separate branch

### 🔹 Pull Requests (PR)
- Create a Pull Request (PR) after completing your changes
- PRs help in reviewing and merging changes safely

## 🌱 Repository Workflow

1. Fork the repository  
2. Clone your forked repo  
3. Create a new branch  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b notes
4. Create a Day folder inside the notes branch
  ```bash
  mkdir Day-01
  cd Day-01
  touch README.md
5. Add your notes to the README.md file
6. Commit your changes
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Added Day 01 notes"
